# Outreach Proposal

## Year 1: Seed 🌰

### Activate Leadership

- Meet with each leader: hear their heart for outreach, pour into their vision, make some plans.
- Achilles Leadership: I think this is where this “model” comes into play, not to find the weakness in one leader and strengthen that weakness. This is where we identify the weakness and ask God to fill that with His strength. This usually involves God bringing someone into the ministry that already has that strength. See how God makes it about connection and community?

### Outreach “Hub”

- Create permanent space for outreach
- Share priorities of the family show in the home
- Work with Deb on creating the space
- Temporary speaks something to the church about outreach in our personal lives: can we “take down” sharing Christ when it is “in the way”?
- Ministry “take-overs”

- Connect NLC peeps to Hope Center
- Bring Hope Center into NLC
